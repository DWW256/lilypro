# lilypro
Some easy-to-use, easy-to-read goodies for use in lilypond.

To use lilypro, just download the file, extract it to somewhere on your hard disk or wherever, and use an \include to include it in your lilypond file.  Put \global-lilypro inside of your "global" expression or all of your music expressions, if that's more your style.  Enjoy!

lilypro does the following things.  If you don't like any of them, then change them yourself.  Now stop bugging me!  :-)

* Change the paper size to letter
* Allow for the last page to be not completely filled up
* Use some prettier fonts (requires fonts.scm patch for 2.18.0â€“2.19.11 functionality)
* Number every measure by default
* Remove the default tagline
* Add support for subito piano (\subitoP) and subito forte (\subitoF)
* Add a \sustainReset command that just resets the sustain pedal
* Commands to hide and show instruments (unfinished)
* Automatically span arpeggios in PianoStaff context
* Mute ChordNames context by default
