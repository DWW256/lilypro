Some easy-to-use, easy-to-read goodies for use in lilypond

lilypro does the following things.  If you don't like any of them, then change them yourself.  Now stop bugging me!  :-)

* Change the paper size to letter
* Allow for the last page to be not completely filled up
* Use some prettier fonts (requires fonts.scm patch for 2.18.0â€“2.19.11 functionality)
* Number every measure by default
* Remove the default tagline
* Add support for subito piano (\subitoP) and subito forte (\subitoF)
* Add a \sustainReset command that just resets the sustain pedal
* Commands to hide and show instruments (unfinished)
* Automatically span arpeggios in PianoStaff context
* Mute ChordNames context by default
